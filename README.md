## Collaboration Plan:


## Objective:
The objective of this grand challenge is to implement the grand challenge one pipe architecture in C/C++ without compiling the runtime  with change in a number of processes and threads, with target CPU.


## Approach:
In our approach, we have considered the main pipe as a master, which will distribute the work to workers. Each worker computes their part and sends back the result to the master. To achieve this goal, we have used OpenMPI to make parallel computation faster.


## Technologies and Frameworks:
  * OpenMPI.
  * C/C++ language.
  * Master Slave.
  * Chrono.
  * Sieve of Eratosthenes.
